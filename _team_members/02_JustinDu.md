position: Communications & Technology Director

bio: Outside of school, Justin loves to dabble in the ocean of programming and technology and remains an active member of the school’s Science Olympiad Team. Although he understands that a perfect world is impossible, Justin strives to improve the community around him, be it organizing school clean-ups, volunteering at local races, or contributing to the global Wikimedia Movement. If not in front of his computer or swamped with homework, Justin can often be found outdoors, most likely playing tennis with his younger brother or throwing a frisbee with the Ultimate Frisbee Club he co-founded. Justin aspires to pursue a biomedical engineering degree in college and looks forward to seeing where that takes him.

talk: His favourite TED Talk is Kelly McGonigal's “How to make stress your friend”.
